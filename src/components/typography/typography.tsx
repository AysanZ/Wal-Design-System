/**
 * Typography is a vital component of any design system. It’s the art of arranging text
 * in a visually appealing and communicative way, forming a consistent visual identity
 * across all elements.
 *
 * At WalUI, we prioritize typography to enhance the user experience. We’ve chosen Roboto
 * for English and Dana for Farsi—both selected for their balance between readability and
 * aesthetics. These fonts make your text clear, elegant, and comfortable to read.
 *
 * Our typography guidelines emphasize consistency and legibility across devices and
 * platforms, ensuring that your content remains easy to understand while presenting a
 * cohesive visual identity.
