/**
 * Figma → "❖ Switch Toggle" page.
 *   Switch Toggle       → Left Icon = On/Off, Only Icon = On/Off, Label, Show Triple
 *   Switch Toggle Items → Type (Default | Left Icon | Only Icon)
 *                         × State (Default · Hover · Active · Disabled)
 *
 * ## The page names are swapped relative to this codebase
 *
 * Figma's **"Toggle"** page is the on/off switch — it lives in
 * `components/switch`. Figma's **"Switch Toggle"** page is the segmented
 * control, and that is this file. An earlier version of this component had it
 * backwards and grew a pile of axes Figma never had: `appearance`
 * (stroke/ghost/filled), `size`, a `multiple` selection mode, a vertical
 * orientation, and an `attached` flag. None of those exist in the design.
 *
 * ## What follows from that
 *
 * - **Selection is single.** A segmented control shows which of N views you
 *   are looking at; two selected segments is not a state any screen renders.
 * - **The track is always joined.** `attached` was a prop for a shape the
 *   design only draws one way.
 * - **Horizontal only.** There is no vertical segmented control in the file.
 *
 * `Show Triple` is the segment count, which is however many children you pass,
 * so it is not a prop either.
