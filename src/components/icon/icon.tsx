/**
 * Sizing / colour / mirroring wrapper around any SVG icon.
 *
 * ## Why this no longer takes `name: string`
 *
 * The previous implementation did `import * as RemixIcons from '@remixicon/react'`
 * and looked the component up by string key. A namespace import combined with
 * a dynamic key is opaque to every bundler, so tree-shaking was disabled and
 * all ~2,830 Remix icons landed in the consumer's bundle — several megabytes
 * for an app that renders three icons.
 *
 * `Icon` now takes the component itself, which keeps named imports statically
 * analysable. If you genuinely need string lookup at runtime — an icon picker,
 * a CMS-driven field, the theme-builder dashboard — import `DynamicIcon` from
 * `@husan/wal-ui/icons`. It lives behind a separate entry point so the cost is
 * opt-in rather than paid by everyone.
 *
 * ```tsx
 * import { RiAddLine } from '@remixicon/react';
 * <Icon icon={RiAddLine} size={20} />
 * ```
 *
 * ## Accessibility
 *
 * Icons are decorative by default (`aria-hidden`): most sit beside a visible
 * label, and announcing them just duplicates the output. Pass `label` when the
 * icon is the only content — an icon-only button, a bare status marker.
 *
 * ## No ref forwarding, on purpose
 *
 * Remix icon components are plain function components that do not call
 * `forwardRef`, so attaching a ref would only produce a React warning and a
 * `null`. If you need a node handle, wrap the icon in an element you control.
