 * Figma → "❖ Toggle" page — *not* "Switch Toggle", which is the segmented

 *
 *   Toggle       → State (Default · Hover · Pressed · Disabled) × Active
 *   Toggle Label → Active × Description × Flip, plus Sublabel, Badge, Link Button
 *
 * State is not a prop — hover, focus and disabled are CSS states, and a
 * `state="focused"` prop produces a control that looks focused but is not.
 *
 * **There is no Size axis.** An earlier version of this file carried
 * `sm`/`md`; Figma has one size only, so the variant is gone.
