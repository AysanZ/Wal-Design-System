 * Figma → "❖ Video Player" page.

 *                  × Size (Medium | Small)
 *
 * The docblock here used to claim `Size (Large | Medium)` and a four-value
 * `State (Idle · Playing · Paused · Loading)`. Both were wrong: the sizes are
 * Medium and Small, and there are three statuses, one of which — Silent Play,
 * i.e. muted autoplay — was not among the four.
 *
 * Status is still not a prop: each of the three is something the `<video>`
 * element already knows and reports through its events. A `status="playing"`
 * prop would be a second source of truth that drifts from the media the moment
 * the user pauses from the keyboard. `muted` is the one input, because muted
 * autoplay is a decision the page makes, not a fact the element reports.
