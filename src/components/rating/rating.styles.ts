 * ## Axes this file used to invent
 *
 * - **`size` (Small | Medium | Large)** does not exist. The docblock here used
 *   to claim it did; there is no Size axis anywhere on the page.
 * - **`color`** does not exist either. Stars are always warning-yellow and
 *   hearts always error-red, which follows from `type` rather than being a
 *   free choice.
 *
 * Value is not a variant. Figma draws each score as its own frame; here the
 * fill comes from `value`, so 3.7 renders as three and a bit — a quantised
 * variant would be a component that cannot show the average it is given.
